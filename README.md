# Multithreaded Web Crawler

## Project Overview

The **Multithreaded Web Crawler** is a tool that crawls websites to retrieve content and metadata using multiple threads concurrently. The project demonstrates the use of **Multithreading** concepts like thread creation, thread pooling, synchronization, and shared resource management.

This project is designed to help developers understand how to efficiently manage concurrent tasks in a multithreaded environment, how to avoid common pitfalls like race conditions, and how to use locks or semaphores to ensure thread safety.

## Features

1. **Multithreaded Crawling**: 
   - Multiple threads fetch web pages concurrently.
   - Each thread processes different URLs from a shared queue.

2. **Page Content Extraction**: 
   - Extracts metadata such as title, URL, and word count from each page.
   - Option to filter specific keywords.

3. **Thread Synchronization**: 
   - Proper handling of shared resources (like URL queue) with mutexes or locks.
   - Use of condition variables to notify threads when new URLs are available.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**: 
   - Logs errors when pages cannot be reached or fetched.
   - Logs the status of each thread and URL it processes.

5. **Configurable Thread Pool**:
   - The number of worker threads can be dynamically adjusted.
   - Prevents the creation of too many threads, controlling system resources.

6. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - Allows the system to shut down cleanly after all threads complete crawling.

## Multithreading Concepts Used

1. **Thread Creation and Management**:
   - Creating and joining threads using thread classes or built-in libraries (e.g., Pythonâ€™s `threading` or Java's `Thread`).

2. **Thread Pooling**:
   - Managing a pool of worker threads that execute tasks from a shared queue.

3. **Shared Resource Management**:
   - Threads share a queue of URLs to be processed and store results in shared data structures.

4. **Synchronization (Mutexes/Locks)**:
   - Ensuring only one thread accesses the shared resource (e.g., URL queue) at a time to prevent race conditions.

5. **Condition Variables**:
   - Notifying threads when new data is available in the shared queue, avoiding busy waiting.

6. **Race Condition Prevention**:
   - Using locks to prevent two or more threads from modifying shared data at the same time.
